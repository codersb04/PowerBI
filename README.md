# PowerBI-Practice
This repository contains my PowerBI practices and projects</br></br>
PowerBI is good tool for data analysis and data processing. It's very handy and easy to understands. With lots of visualization options, it helps us to better understand our data. With function of 'Tranform data' we can easily processes our data and clean our dataset like removing the Null values, Changing the type of column, Unpivoting the table using Power query and these changes can be undone also in simplified way.</br></br>
